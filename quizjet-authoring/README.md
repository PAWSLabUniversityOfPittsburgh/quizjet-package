How to develop the project?

(1) The UI is implemented using React framework.
The files are in React Component.

Here are some useful commands using React.

sudo npm install webpack-dev-server -g

npm install --save-dev jsx-loader

npm install --save react react-dom

npm install brace

sudo npm install react-ace

webpack-dev-server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8090

(2)
Before you start, try to have a basic idea of React and Webpack. When you develop locally, you can edit the react project directly. The webpack host the react project and will automatically generate a bundle js file on the path /assets/bundle.js in the react project. When you want to deploy the project, just copy the compressed js into the resources/js/bundle.min.js in the Eclipse project.
Check the following lines in home.jsp to understand how js file is imported.

<c:choose>

		<c:when test="${domain == 'localhost'}">

	<script src="http://localhost:9090/webpack-dev-server.js"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost:9090/assets/bundle.js"></script>

    	</c:when>

    	<c:otherwise>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="${baseURL}/resources/js/bundle.min.js"></script>

    	</c:otherwise>

	</c:choose>
